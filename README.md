# Packet Sniffer
_**University Project â€“ Aldo Fumagalli, Francesco Torregrossa, A.A. 19/20**_

We have created a C program that monitors and analyzes all the packets received by the computer, allowing us to show details such as the source, the recipient, the protocols used (Ethernet, IPv4, ICMP, TCP and UDP), and even the contents they carry.

Then, we installed the program on an [OrangePi](http://www.orangepi.org) device equipped with a TP-Link [TL-WN722N](https://www.tp-link.com/it/home-networking/adapter/tl-wn722n/) wireless network card.

We have also prepared a mock website using PHP, HTML and CSS (Client/Server) that simulates an audio streaming platform with login, sign up and other generic features.

In this way, by accessing and using the website via a browser, we were able to simulate sending some packages that were then analyzed by our program, running on the OrangePi. This allowed us to access sensitive data and verify the correctness of the information obtained by the program itself.

A thorough [report](relazione/Relazione.pdf) is available in Italian. You can also refer to the original [README](README-IT.md).
